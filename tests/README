This directory contains automated tests of DFTRES.

To run the tests, execute 'sh test.sh [--dft] [options]', where
[options] is a list of options accepted by DFTRES (e.g. --zvav or
-n 10000).

The tests are listed in 'tests.txt', formatted as:
	filename	"options"	reference_result
where the options should specify the metric to calculate, and the
reference result should be an interval known to contain the true value.

If '--dft' is included, the tests in 'dfttests.txt' are also performed.
These are .dft files which require DFTCalc to run.

Tests are performed using a static seed and four threads, so they should
be reproducible.
